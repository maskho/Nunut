## (Open for any contributions!)  

[Nunut](https://nunut.kobar.co) is a new and innovative ride-sharing (nebeng) platform that has the potential as a soft power tool to drive behavioral change among users, increasing their awareness of climate change and encouraging more sustainable transportation habits. The app should always be easy to use and affordable, offering features that make it a more sustainable and safe way to get around.
